To run this code with the dataset provided in the assignment, simply run "python linear_regression.py". You may need to do "pip install matplotlib" if you have not previously installed this library.

Additionally, sometimes python executes in a different directory than the file is located in. This means it may not be able to find the file it needs to read the data from. If you get the "file not found" error,
edit the file path variable in the code to include the full path to the file on your system.

If you would like to run this code on other data sets, simply change the name of the file path variable to point to the new file. 
Ensure the new file has the same format, where there is x values in column 0 and y values in column 1.
